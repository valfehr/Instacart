# Instacart
## Recommendation Engine

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [xgboost](https://pypi.org/project/xgboost/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Code

The code is provided in the `Instacart_recommendation.ipynb` file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Instacart_recommendation.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Instacart_recommendation.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

This dataset was made public during the 2017 kaggle competition which aimed at predicting reorders and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data). 
However, the data we use here has been slightly modified to fit Capgemini's needs.

It is made up of 50000 products, 200000 unique users and several million orders.
